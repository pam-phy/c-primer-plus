You should have no problem recalling which direction
operator does what. Just remember that each operator points
in the direction the information flows. Think of it as a
funnel.
The world is too much with us: late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in Nature that is ours;
We have given our heart away, a sordid boon!
